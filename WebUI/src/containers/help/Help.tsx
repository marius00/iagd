            The "<i>Multiple PC</i>" checkbox in Item Assistant is an addition to the backup system.<br/>
            If you have enabled backups by logging in with an e-mail, it's possible to synchronize your items between
            multiple PCs in ~realtime.<br/><br/>
            This can useful if you play Grim Dawn on several PCs, or if you share your stash with a loved one, as you'll
            be using the same IA stash across installs.<br/><br/>

            The checkbox under settings makes IA sync items more aggressively, opting for near-instant syncronization
            instead of low bandwidth usage.
            IA will not synchronize your characters, only your items.<br/>

            Item Assistant lets you show recipes and augments as items, as a reminder that you can obtain them.<br/>

            Go to settings and disable "Show recipes as items" and "Show augments as items". <br/><br/>

            Sometimes bugs can happen which causes an <u>exact duplicate</u> of an item to be spawned. <br/>
            This is an item with the exact same stats etc, it's not an item that was actually found, but was <u>spawned
            due to a bug.</u><br/><br/>

            <b>It goes as follows:</b> <br/>
            <ol>
                <li>IA loots the item</li>
                <li>IA deletes the item from the game.</li>
                <li>You open your stash, and Grim Dawn recreates the item (bug) instead of reading the changes made by
                    IA.

                <li>The item now exists both in the game and in IA. [bugged duplicate]</li>

            </ol>

            Enabling the "delete bugged duplicates" option under settings will cause IA to simply delete these bugged

            The way IA creates backups to say Dropbox is by detecting the installation folder, and placing a zip file

            provider.<br/>
            <br/>
            If the icon is disabled, it means IA was not able to automatically detect where you have the cloud sync

            <br/>
            Any time you loot an item it will be synced up to the cloud. If anything happens and you need to reinstall
