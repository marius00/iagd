Yes, this file is much smaller than your other userdata.db file, THIS IS NORMAL!

The regular userdata.db contains a lot of parsed data from Grim Dawn which the client can rebuild on its own.

Just copy this userdata.db file into data\, start IA, then go to the "Mods" tab, select vanilla and parse the database.


Please check the 'help' tab before crying for help, most likely it answere your question ;)
