Pending:
* Remove any excess sqlite libraries
* Check what we need in terms of VC++ runtimes (can prolly remove some, like old cefsharp one?)
* Spamming task cancelled:        private static AccessStatus IsTokenValid(string user, string token) {
* New backup login nag modal
* Make IAGD copy dependencies\, should only be missing the primary iagd DLL File on a regular build. (and maybe not even that?)
- Do we still need to parse all shit like item skills?
- Seems GD is parsing in the menu again? Not ideal.. ReplicaItem


Patch notes:
* Now uses WebView2 (edge-chromium) instead of CefSharp Chromium for the items view
* Replaced the deprecated Ionic.Zip with the native .net zip
* The version format is now 1.year.monthday.hourminute (1.yy.
* Now uses .Net 9 instead of .Net Framework 4.7.2 (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-9.0.9-windows-x64-installer)
* IAGD is now 64 bit (previously it ran as 32bit despite requiring 64bit Grim Dawn)
* Installer size is ~90mb smaller than before
* Lots of updated dependencies
* A few bug fixes (and probably new bugs introduced)
* Perhaps marginally better dark mode

- Fixed a crash in menu[]
